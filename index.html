      <h6 class="text-center mb-5">MetallicA through the years 1981 to the current years</h6>
      <p>
        The best way I can describe Metallicas music is through their bass players. There has been debates on Metallica selling out from their fans from the beginning before their Kill 'Em All album and with the recording of self-titled album Metallica, better known as the "<strong>Black Album</strong>", with producer Bob Rocks. The biggest reason why my heart still pounds Metallica, is that they are not afraid to play the style they want. Most artists it's hard to tell what album a song comes from, because there style is real simular. But, with Metallica every album has a different style. The one known fact is that Cliff was a big classical freak and you could hear that on the "<strong>Ride the Lightening</strong>" album, when he was involved in the recording process. So as Cliff says "<strong>Bang Them Heads That Don't Bang</strong>"
        <br>
        Leather Charm was formed in June 1981 following the demise of Phantom Lord, a garage band featuring James Hetfield and guitarist Hugh Tanner. At the time, Hetfield was living with an older brother in Brea, California and attending Brea Olinda High School after the unforeseen death of his mother. In the new band, Hetfield and Tanner were joined by Hetfield's childhood friend and roommate Ron McGovney, and later drummer Jim Mulligan. While Hetfield had played guitar in Phantom Lord, he acted solely as lead vocalist in Leather Charm. Tanner was replaced several months later by guitarist Troy James.

        The group was influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal and practiced covers of songs by such bands of the period, including Diamond Head and Sweet Savage. They were also influenced by Iron Maiden and covered their songs "Remember Tomorrow" and "Wrathchild".

        When Mulligan left the group in late 1981, Leather Charm disbanded and Hetfield began working with drummer Lars Ulrich on a new band, Metallica. Early the next year, McGovney and guitarist Dave Mustaine completed Metallica's first gigging lineup. The Leather Charm song "Hit the Lights" was integrated into the band's set among the first original compositions in the band's repertoire, and eventually became the opening track on their debut album, Kill 'Em All.
      <br>
        Metallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, The Recycler, which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden." Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar. The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.
      <br>
        The bands name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine and was considering MetalMania or Metallica. After hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted the latter for his band, so he suggested Quintana use MetalMania instead.
